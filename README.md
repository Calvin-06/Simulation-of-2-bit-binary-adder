This project was simply based on the practical of our previous module Digital logic. 
To build this 2_bit_binary adder we used logic gates, truth tables and arithmetic circuits concepts.
Also Logisism software help simulate the final circuits and test it's functionality. The simmulation is very simple and below is a link to our published youtube video and report:
